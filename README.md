# Flip-The-Cards
A web  game based on popular Flip Card game.

========= A look at Game ==========
The game has '3 Levels'. out of which first 2 get random images from Picsum api and last one gets images from Robohash api.
So, the images are random and have variety!
The game also has a timer.

=========  A look at Code ==========
The concept was to make use of Vanilla JS to inject data into html and understand about the working of modern JS libraries like ReactJS,AngularJS..

========== Things to Add + ==========
1. Make it responsive on other screens.
2. Make a highscore system.
3. Improve overall functionality.
